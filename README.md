JLib
====

If you're looking for the library with Reflection and Direct memory stuff you can find that here now:
https://github.com/FilipDev/JHack

A very useful library that gives support for all needs when developing for things much more efficiently.
This library also greatly makes writing code more efficient in ways such as giving Singleton classes to extend, a singleton Random,
a Random class, that is many times more random in the result it gives, and more.
