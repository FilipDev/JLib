JLib
====

A very useful library that gives support for all needs when developing for things that are typically complicated. 
This library also greatly makes writing code more efficient in ways such as giving Singleton classes to extend, a singleton Random,
a Random class, that is many times more random in the file it gives, and more.
It makes direct memory modification a breeze, and reflection something to scoff at. It is very useful for doing things that
you aren't supposed to do in Java.
